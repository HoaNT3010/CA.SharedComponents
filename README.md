# CA.SharedComponents

A collection of reusable building blocks for .NET applications following **Clean Architecture**, **DDD**, **CQRS** principles, just to name a few.

> 📚 **Learning Project:**
> This repository is primarily developed as a personal learning project to deepen understanding of software architecture patterns and best practices in modern .NET development.

## Overview

`CA.SharedComponents` is designed as a **modular shared library solution**, consisting of multiple layers:

- **Domain** → Core DDD building blocks (no dependencies)
- **Application** → CQRS abstractions and behaviors
- **Infrastructure** → Persistence and technical implementations

The goal is to explore how to design **reusable, maintainable, and scalable components** that can be shared across multiple projects.

## Goals

- Practice and apply **Clean Architecture**
- Gain hands-on experience with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- Implement **CQRS patterns** using MediatR
- Understand trade-offs in designing shared libraries
- Build a reusable foundation for future projects

## Architecture

The solution follows a layered structure:

```
CA.SharedComponents
│
├── src
│   │
│   ├── SharedDomain
│   │
│   ├── SharedApplication
│   │
│   └── SharedInfrastructure
│
└── tests
    │
    ├── SharedDomain.Tests
    │
    ├── SharedApplication.Tests
    │
    └── SharedInfrastructure.Tests
```

Please checkout each project's README file for additional information.

## Packages

This repository is intended to be split into multiple NuGet packages:

| Package                              | Description                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `CA.SharedComponents.Domain`         | Core domain primitives (dependency-free) |
| `CA.SharedComponents.Application`    | CQRS + MediatR abstractions              |
| `CA.SharedComponents.Infrastructure` | EF Core + persistence implementations    |

> Consumers should only reference what they need.
